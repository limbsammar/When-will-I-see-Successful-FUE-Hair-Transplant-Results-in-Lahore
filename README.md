People often wonder how long it will take to see [**FUE hair transplant results in Lahore**](https://hairtransplantt.com/fue-hair-transplant-results-lahore/). For instance, you should know how long will it take to have definitive results?

First and foremost, when considering a hair transplant schedule, remember that you won't magically have a full head of hair the morning after the procedure. The hair restoration process takes time. And while this might be irritating, keep in mind the old proverb, "The best things come to those who wait." It usually takes about a year from the day of surgery to see the full results of fresh hair growth.

**What happens during the transplant surgery?**

Anaesthesia will have been administered to both the donor and the recipient locations. The process by which the brain receives pain signals from the nerves is interrupted by local anaesthetic.

Local anaesthetic effects begin to fade between 4 and 6 hours after administration. Using caution around the numbed area is important because you cannot feel pain if you are hurt. You may also notice that the areas feel tight or bloated. You can feel some tingling or burning when the local anaesthetic wears off.

The adrenaline in the local anaesthetic may also have shrunk the blood vessels, giving the appearance of paler skin. When the anaesthesia wears off, your skin's natural tone will return. There may be some redness where the new hairs have been inserted. This redness often goes away during the first week or two.

However, it may linger longer for those with fair or sensitive skin. The bandages covering your donor site will be removed the next day. There should be some bleeding in the dressing.

**In which areas treatment is done?**

FUE are typically performed in areas of the body with little to no hair. FUE can be performed on the scalp, the body, or the privates.

**Is there any risk for harm or negative effects?**

Scarring from an FUE hair transplant is minimal to little white spots at the extraction sites. Time may cause them to disappear.

Please consult your physician if you experience any signs of an infection or crust or drainage at the site of the operation. Postoperative discomfort, such as pain or swelling will also happen. You will experience tingling or numbness at the surgical incision

**What to expect after FUE surgery?**

FUE has a short recuperation time. For around three days, you can have some swelling or pain. Your doctor may provide you few post-treatment instructions. Keep your hair and body unwashed for at least three days.

For the first few weeks of hair washing, it is recommended to use mild, unscented shampoos. To hasten recovery, you should take a few days off of work. Wait at least three weeks before combing or brushing your new hair.

Until your doctor gives the all-clear, refrain from donning any headgear. You shouldn't push yourself too hard physically for at least a week.

Hair loss is a normal part of the healing process. Three to four months is a reasonable estimate for when you'll begin to see results.
